# pio - pretty I/O<img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" />

`pio` is a package to print nice coloured outputs to the console.

If you work with R scripts that generate several loads or outputs, or if you just like to organize in a tidy way on-screen outputs of your computataions, then `pio`'s pretty I/O system is the package that you are looking for.

`pio` explots the great `crayon` [package](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) to render couloured text to the console. The package provides a very simple interface to visualize three types of messages:

* headers;
* titles with separators;
* strings with coloured values;

Use `pio` to easily achieve a tidy and coloured organisation of your messages, so that your users will find it easier to spot relevant information from your functions' outputs.
