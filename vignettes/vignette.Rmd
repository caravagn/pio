The **pretty I/O** R package `pio` provides functions to layout coloured outputs to console, in a neat way. If you work constantly with R scripts that generate several outputs, a tidy organisation of your outputs makes it easier to spot relevant information on the fly.

`pio` relies a lot on `crayon`, which provides some simple functions to add colours to terminals.

## Example: header and parameters

You have your beautiful function
```R
myFun = function(x, y, z, w, ...) { 
   print(
      paste("Function to do this and that, run with ", x, y, z, w)
   )

   ... all the juicy bits ...

 }
```

With ``pio``, you can be more kind to other people and organize its header
```R
myFun = function(x, y, z, w, ...) 
{ 
   # Call to the pio header function
   pioHdr("My new cool function to do this and that",
      toPrint = c(
         `Significance (alpha)` = x,
         `Statistical test` = y,
         `Multiple Hypothesis Correction` = z,
         `Plots` = w
      ),
      prefix = '\t-')

   ... still the juicy bits ...

 }
```

The output (in my RStudio) will look like this

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp.png")
```

## Example: other prints

You have a few functions to use. In what follows we cannot render the colour, but I swear it is there.
* print a "title", which will be wrapped with '-'

```R
> pio::pioTit("Some cool computation")

---------------------
Some cool computation
---------------------
```
* print a string/ value with ``pioStr``;
* use a display function ``pioDisp`` that tries to convert its input to a ``tibble``, and exploit its tibble's functions (which are already cool).

## Changing colour codes

`pio` uses R's options to understand which colours should be used. Everybody can set this to create his favourite colour combinations.

* `pio.header_bg_colour` is the background colour of the header, default is ``crayon::bgBlue``;
* `pio.header_fg_colour` is the foreground colour of the header, default is ``crayon::white``;
* `pio.args_colour` is the foreground colour of the arguments, default is ``crayon::cyan``;
* `pio.title_fg_colour` is the foreground colour of a title, default is ``crayon::cyan``;
* `pio.string_fg_colour` is the foreground colour of a string, default is ``crayon::cyan``;

**Example.** Change colours of the header: black text on orange background

```R
options('pio.header_bg_colour' = crayon::bgYellow)
options('pio.header_bg_colour' = crayon::bgYellow)
```
The output will now look like this
